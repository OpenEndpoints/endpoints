From a technical point of view, OpenEndpoints does something very similar to a static website generator. It fetches data from independent data sources and applies templates to convert it into content.

But rather than creating pre-fabricated content (“static website”), OpenEndpoints is the solution to serve on-demand generated content:

- Paged media such as "Download PDF" where the PDF is dynamically generated to have user-defined content and layout.
- Dynamic HTML snippets where content and layout can be different depending on the origin of a request (IP, ...), the  current date/time, the availability of a product, or even the value of a cookie.
- Dynamic landing pages where the complete content and layout might depend on parameters passed from (for example) Google Adwords.

Like Gatsby - but for dynamic content

Static content will continue to be created via systems like Gatsby, for example. But those sub-areas that require a dynamic feed can be inserted with OpenEndpoints. In both cases, the content can come from the same headless CMS, for example.
