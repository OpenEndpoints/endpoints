OpenEndpoints allows generating documents, where the layout is separated from the content. This is called a **data-driven document layout**. Advantages of this concept include: 

- Reusability of templates for different content
- Easy maintenance of content
- Unlimited flexibility in adapting content structure, style and layout to different products, audiences, etc.

## Templates Without Separated Content

Solutions for **automated document generation** usually use templates in which the content itself actually is part of the template, and “dynamic” elements are inserted into placeholders. That approach has some disadvantages:

- Each time the content has changed, the template itself must be adapted.
- For a flexible layout, which in individual cases requires different text lengths, different sources and sometimes even different content structures, this concept is technically limited.
- Not really suitable for content available in different languages. In fact, you will have to create a separate template for each language.
