## Like "Gatsby" for On-Demand Generated Content.

From a technical point of view, OpenEndpoints does something very similar to a static website generator. It fetches data from independent data sources and applies templates to convert it into content.

But rather than creating pre-fabricated content (“static website”), OpenEndpoints is the solution to serve on-demand generated content:

- Paged media such as "Download PDF" where the PDF is dynamically generated to have user-defined content and layout.
- Dynamic HTML snippets where content and layout can be different depending on the origin of a request (IP, ...), the  current date/time, the availability of a product, or even the value of a cookie.
- Dynamic landing pages where the complete content and layout might depend on parameters passed from (for example) Google Adwords.

Static content will continue to be created via systems like Gatsby, for example. But those sub-areas that require a dynamic feed can be inserted with OpenEndpoints. In both cases, the content can come from the same headless CMS, for example.
