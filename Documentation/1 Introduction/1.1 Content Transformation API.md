OpenEndpoints is free and open source software, with which one can set up REST APIs via simple configuration. These REST APIs act as a universal tool in the content transformation ecosystem.

## Content Transformation

The core feature of OpenEndpoints is **loading and combining structured data from different data sources** and creating something new from this data, which can then be delivered via the respective endpoint.

$plugin[{
    "type": "image",
    "data": {
        "url": "https:\/\/image-archive.developerhub.io\/image\/upload\/v2_4781\/fnxkualuzubvuzemdlxv\/1631865476.svg",
        "mode": "responsive",
        "width": 877,
        "height": 362,
        "caption": null
    }
}]$

A wide variety of data sources are supported, the content of which can be transformed on-the-fly to PDF, HTML, text files and much more. See: [auto$](/documentation/data-source-transformation).

## Easy Deployment

OpenEndpoints can be installed quickly and easily with a Docker container. With a single installation, multiple applications can be created and operated in parallel, each of which can contain multiple endpoints.

## API First

OpenEndpoints has - with the exception of a small admin tool - no GUI. The use of OpenEndpoints expects, for example, independent web applications or simple web forms to send a request to a REST API created by OpenEndpoints.
