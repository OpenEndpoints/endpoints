### Description

This software takes XML from multiple sources (e.g. URLs, files, or any Java class you write which can produce XML). You configure what sources you want, and the software combines the XML from those sources into one XML file in memory. The XML is then optionally transformed using XSLT. The resulting document is then optionally converted into PDF, XLS or JSON. The resulting file is then either downloaded to the browser, or a sent as an email, or you can write a Java class which performs any action on the file, or any combination of the above.
