# First Steps After Installation

OpenEndpoints installed in "Multi Application Mode" (see [Deployment Modes](../docker-container/deployment-modes.md)) comes with a service portal for administration:

`https://[your-base-url]/service-portal`

Note that in "Single Application Mode" your application is already packed with the Docker container.

## Default Login

A default account for the admin is automatically created during installation:
