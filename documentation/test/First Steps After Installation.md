OpenEndpoints installed in "Multi Application Mode" (see [auto$](/documentation/installation-deployment-modes)) comes with a service portal for administration:

`https://[your-base-url]/service-portal`

Note that in "Single Application Mode" your application is already packed with the Docker container.

## Default Login

A default account for the admin is automatically created during installation:

$plugin[{
    "type": "image",
    "data": {
        "url": "https:\/\/image-archive.developerhub.io\/image\/upload\/v2_4781\/rlvqgdelhiqweebev28q\/1635151650.png",
        "mode": "responsive",
        "width": 1578,
        "height": 1236,
        "caption": null
    }
}]$

$plugin[{
    "type": "callout",
    "data": {
        "text": "Don't forget to set a new password as soon as possible!",
        "type": "warning",
        "title": "Security Alert"
    }
}]$
